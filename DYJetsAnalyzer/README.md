# GENstudy

Setup up repo by running the following:

```
1. cmsrel CMSSW_10_6_18
2. cd CMSSW_10_6_18/src/
3. cmsenv
4. git clone https://github.com/Michael-Krohn/GENstudy.git
5. scram b
```

First, create a txt file that contains the file paths for every GEN root file, one per line. Also, begin each file path with 'file:/hdfs/...'. For an example, see datafiles/DYJets_m200.txt
